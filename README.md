# yosys-syn
Zero Asic synthesis plugin for Yosys : 'yosys-syn'

Introduction :
------------
This repository stores the Zero Asic synthesis plugin that provides both FPGA and Asic synthesis flows.

The plugin is called 'yosys-syn' and it provides two top level commands : 

	1/ 'synth_fpga' : this top level command corresponds to 
            the FPGA synthesis flow.  This flow is partially 
            implemented. 
            Once plugin is loaded under Yosys, you need to type 
            "help synth_fpga" to get all the options.

	2/ 'synth_asic' : this top level command corresponds to 
           the Asic synthesis flow. This flow is not implemented 
           yet.

How to build :
-------------
You need to have 'yosys-config' executable installed.

Then, to build 'yosys-syn', please type either 'make yosys-syn' or 'make' for short.

A 'yosys-syn.so' share object library file will be generated and can be plugged-in with a Yosys
executable.

How to link 'yosys-syn' with Yosys :
-----------------------------------
You need to add 'yosys-syn.so' under 'yosys/share/plugins/' if 'yosys' is your
Yosys repository (note that Yosys is already compiled and there is no need to 
recompile it again).

When this is done, you can use it either way: 

            1/ at command line : 

                  yosys -m ./yosys-syn.so -s <script file>

            2/ Or directly in the Yosys executable : 

                  plugin -i yosys-syn
